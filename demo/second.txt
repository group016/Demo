Functional programming is a paradigm that allows programming using expressions 
i.e. declaring functions, 
passing functions as arguments and using functions as statements
 (rightly called expressions in Java8).
 
A Java 8 lambda expression (or function) is just an anonymous function, i.e., 
a function with no name and without being bound to an identifier.
